 <p>My story started about a decade before I was born when both my parents came to Sweden in the end of the 1970s fleeing war in the Middle East. This is a pivotal event that has affected my life tremendously. I am born and raised in Huskvarna, a small town in the idyllic and traditional area called Småland in Sweden, famous for the multinational manufacturer of outdoor products of the same name. I grew up there with my mother and two sisters. Being an immigrant and raising three children by herself, my mother had to struggle to make ends meet. This is another pivotal circumstance that has shaped my life. 
  <br>
  Growing up I was often described as a curious and energetic child who constantly questioned everything, not to be annoying – but to learn. I have always loved to learn and since I can remember I have gathered knowledge through reading books. Lately I have complemented my thirst for theoretical knowledge with a lust for learning new practical skills. The last two years I have started crocheting, paint and create clay figures. 
  <br>
  I never liked Huskvarna or Jönköping (where we eventually moved) and as soon as I graduated, I left. The following years I lived in London, Stockholm, Paris, and Dublin. Leaving the familiar and living in new places, getting to now new people, and trying out new things fundamentally impacted my life and who I was becoming. Eventually I started university and had my first jobs in Stockholm, although never feeling quite at home in the city. A few years later I fell in love which led me to leave Stockholm for Malmö. Five years later, the relationship has ended but I am still in Malmö. Sitting here, at my favorite coffee place and writing this application, I feel really at home.
  <br>
  I am often described as an organized person since I choose to work methodically with planning, execution, and evaluation. I prefer to know the full context in which I am working to get a better understanding of the bigger picture. This makes it possible for me to be more efficient and take own initiatives. 
  I can be perceived as both tough (getting an assignment done no matter what) and friendly (making sure the whole team feel included). Having both of these sides equally strong is something that I really like about myself.

<h2>Why I want to study this course</h2>
<p>
  I have been involved in the Swedish civil society for a long time. At first as a volunteer and later as a career choice. 
  For the past four years I have worked at the Swedish Red Cross as an operational developer. Getting hired at such a profound 
  employer in the civil society was one of my life goals. Having this goal fulfilled have made me eager to find a new career path. 
  For this reason, I have tried different MOOC courses to find out what I am interested in learning further. Through Technigo's initiative 
  “Tjejer kodar” I did a four-day course in web developing learning some basics. 
  After this I was hooked and continued learning by myself through YouTube. For the first time in a long time, I was excited again, 
  eager to learn and develop new skills in this, for me, completely new field. What really appeals to me is the logic. There is a 
  right and wrong and a way to do things and it is universal all over the world. Having my background in the social science I am more 
  use to that there is no right or wrong, only better, or worse ways to argue for you standpoint.

<h2>Why I will be a great developer</h2>
<p>
  Primarily I will be a good developer thanks to my curiosity and eagerness to continuously learn. 
  I am constantly looking for ways to evolve and in the field of development I will have many opportunities 
  to expand my competence. For example, through learning new programming languages. Additionally, I have a 
  background that is nowhere close to the field of IT. I have a bachelor's in human rights, a master's in gender 
  studies and several years of professional experience in different NGO's working with a variety of issues. I 
  believe that my different background gives me a broad perspective on issues which will contribute to my learning 
  and advancing as a developer. Lastly, in my short time coding so far, I have learned that I like to debug and have 
  a lot of patience for it. For me, debugging becomes thrilling because what it all comes down to is to find irregularities 
  and make them align to the structure.
